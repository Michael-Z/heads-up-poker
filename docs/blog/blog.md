# Blog: Heads Up Computer Poker

## Second Blog Entry - 09/02/17

Recently I have been working on processing the data from the University of Alberta computer research group. I have created classes to both automatically pull and unpack the the data (the data is stored in .tar.gz files).
I have also created classes to process the data and get the two player games from the data. I did this by using several classes to read across multiple relevant files in order to pull the data needed into one game record.

Further on from this, I still need to write tests for these classes - I plan to write unit tests using Junit and also some component tests.


## First Blog Entry
The last few weeks I have spent working on other course work as I put in a good bit of research nearer to the start of the year on this project.
I have decided to implement the poker AI using a neural network. I'll also be working with some of the sample data provided by the University of Alberta computer poker research group. Information on this data can be found [here] (http://poker.cs.ualberta.ca/irc_poker_database.html).
The data will be used for clustering, specifically to cluster types of player together. I'll be concentrating on two main attributes in a players playing type/style - their tightness/looseness and passiveness/aggressiveness. Definitions on these terms can be found [here] (http://www.pokerology.com/lessons/poker-playing-styles/).


Recently though, I have spent time recently working on my functional specification, which can found in this git repository. 
It helped me identify and focus on the functional requirements of this project, specifically focussing on the end project. It also gave me a good idea of what I should be researching and looking into now for the time being. I plan to start development of this project in Week '13', after all other assignments for this semester have been completed and submitted.
