## Second Blog Entry - 09/02/17

Recently I have been working on processing the data from the University of Alberta computer research group. I have created classes to both automatically pull and unpack the the data (the data is stored in .tar.gz files).
I have also created classes to process the data and get the two player games from the data. I did this by using several classes to read across multiple relevant files in order to pull the data needed into one game record.

Further on from this, I still need to write tests for these classes - I plan to write unit tests using Junit and also some component tests.
