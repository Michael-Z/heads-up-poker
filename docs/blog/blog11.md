## Blog 21/05/17

So over the past few days, I've been working mainly on my documentation, however I have been spending most of my time studying in the past few weeks.


I've managed to piece together and finish off 'final' version of the technical guide and user manual. This documentation took me quite a while to do, and Im happy enough with the result.


### Video
Today I have also been working on the video walkthrough. I used [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) to record the screen and microphone, and used [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/lae/imovie/) on my brothers mac to piece it together and publish it. The video walkthrough includes an introduction to the project and a walkthrough on some scenarios a typical user might undertake such as:

- Logging in
- Determining what different objects are on the board (stacks and cards etc.)
- Folding
- Betting
- Calling, Checking
- Showdown scenario


As a side note, yesterday I also decided to split the blogs into their own individual files, as well as have them in the way they are presented in this file here. I think that the individual files are probably easier to read. 

### Onwards
I'm now looking forward and preparing for both the Expo on Tuesday and the presentation on Wednesday!
