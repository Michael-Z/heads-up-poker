# Heads Up Computer Poker
This project allows users to play Heads-Up Texas holdâ€™em no limit poker. Heads-Up poker is one-on-one poker in which the blinds increase as the game progresses. 

The project consists of the Poker AI, developed in Java, and an AngularJS/HTML5 front end which allows users to play a game against the AI in their web browser.
